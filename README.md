## üìå Introduction

This lab introduces essential network administration tasks such as system logging, traffic monitoring, and router redundancy.  There will be configurations Syslog for centralized logging, NetFlow for traffic analysis, and VRRP for high availability.


## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNOLOGY & TOOLS UTILIZED
- **`VirtualBox:`**  
  Used as the primary virtualization platform to host multiple virtual machines in an isolated local environment for cybersecurity testing and infrastructure simulation.

- **`NetFlow (Traffic Monitoring):`**  
  Monitors and exports IP traffic data to a collector

- **`OS/Platform:`**  
  Linux;Hosts router/firewall, `syslog server` , `NetFlow` exporter/collector

- **`VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol):`**  
A protocol that is used to provide redundancy and failover in a network. Itenables the routers in a virtual router group to sharet he same IP address and provides a mechanism for quickly switching the IP address from one router to another in the event of a failure.


## OBJECTIVES:

The objective of the Network Administrator Lab is to provide hands-on experience in configuring and monitoring essential network services. 
Specifically this lab aims to:

- Configure and verify Syslog for centralized event logging.
- Set up and analyze NetFlow exports for traffic monitoring.
- Implement VRRP for router redundancy and high availability.
- View and interpret interface statistics to assess network device health.
